=========

Requirements
------------
This role is setup to authenticate to a windows domain server with kerberos and all required packages to run windows winrm for remote windows management with ansible.

Role Variables
--------------
All Kerberos variables are eligble to be set. However a few are set by default. If you wish to change them, you can specifiy the variable in your inventory file. They are the following:
```
#defaults for Kerberos
dns_lookup_realm: "true"
dns_lookup_kdc: "true"
ticket_lifetime: "24h"
renew_lifetime: "7d"
forwardable: "true"
rdns : "false"
```

however for a normal install, the following are needed:
```
#Domain name
realm_name=YOURDOMAIN.LCL
#hostname of Domain Server
kdc_hostname=yourdomainctl
admin_hostname=yourdomainctl
```

Dependencies
------------
There are no dependencies requred for this role

The dependencies for Linux, are all installed by this role.

For Windows 2k12 and 2k16 the powershell script in files needs to be run in through a privledged Powershell. 

For Windows 2k8 the folllowing is required for some ansible modules to work:
Server 2008 R2 Service pack 1
Powershell v4. via Windows Management Framework 4.0 build 6.1
To check what version of powershell is installed, run the following in powershell:
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
